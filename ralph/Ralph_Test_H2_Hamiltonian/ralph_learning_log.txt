# Ralph Learning Log - H2 Hamiltonian Generation with PySCF

## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-29

### Current State
- Project initialized with PRD.json describing H2 Hamiltonian generation task
- PySCF 2.12.0 is installed in base Python environment
- No previous progress recorded in progress.txt
- Objective: Generate H2 molecule Hamiltonian at 0.5 Å bond length using PySCF
- Acceptance criteria include: HF calculation, FCI energy, Hamiltonian info extraction, JSON output, validation against benchmark

### Observations
- PRD specifies strict validation procedure with external validation script
- Need to produce h2_results.json with specific format
- AGENTS.md contains PySCF patterns for molecule definition, HF calculation, and FCI
- This is a foundational benchmark test for quantum computational chemistry tasks

### Decisions
1. Create Python script `generate_h2_hamiltonian.py` that performs all required calculations
2. Follow PySCF patterns from AGENTS.md for molecule definition at 0.5 Å bond length
3. Extract Hamiltonian information (core Hamiltonian, two-electron integrals)
4. Compute HF and FCI energies
5. Output results to h2_results.json in specified format
6. Create learning log to document process
7. Run validation script to verify implementation

### Plan
- Write script with proper imports and molecule definition
- Perform Hartree-Fock calculation
- Extract molecular integrals
- Compute FCI energy
- Format results as JSON
- Execute validation script
- Update progress and knowledge base

### Challenges Anticipated
- Need to ensure JSON format matches validation script expectations
- Need to verify PySCF installation works correctly
- Need to handle potential numerical precision issues in validation

### Next Steps
Begin implementation of generate_h2_hamiltonian.py
### Implementation Start
- Creating generate_h2_hamiltonian.py script
- Using PySCF patterns from AGENTS.md
- Bond length: 0.5 Å, basis set: sto-3g
- Will compute HF energy, FCI energy, extract Hamiltonian

### Issue: PySCF not found in default python3
- PySCF appears not to be installed in the current python3 environment
- Need to locate PySCF installation or install it
- According to AGENTS.md, PySCF 2.12.0 is installed via pip in base Python environment
- May need to use a different Python interpreter or activate environment

### Results and Validation
- Successfully generated H2 Hamiltonian with PySCF
- HF energy: -1.0429962745 Hartree (matches benchmark)
- FCI energy: -1.0551597945 Hartree (matches benchmark)
- Number of qubits: 4 (spin orbitals)
- Hamiltonian Hermitian: True
- Created h2_results.json with required format
- Validation script passed all checks
- Validation summary saved to validation_summary.txt

### Lessons Learned
1. PySCF installation is in conda base environment; need to use `conda run -n base python` for execution
2. FCI calculation must use `fci.FCI(mf)` rather than manual integral transformation to avoid errors
3. Validation script provides detailed feedback and is essential for verifying correctness
4. The benchmark file provides expected values and tolerances for validation

### Completion
All acceptance criteria met. Objective completed successfully.
