## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-29
- Read PRD.json and identified H2 Hamiltonian generation objective (high priority)
- Created learning log to document thought process and decisions
- Wrote Python script generate_h2_hamiltonian.py using PySCF
- Initial script had incorrect FCI energy due to integral transformation issues
- Debugged and corrected FCI calculation using pyscf.fci.FCI(mf) method
- Generated h2_results.json with correct HF and FCI energies matching benchmark
- Ran validation script: all checks passed
- Hamiltonian properties: 4 qubits, Hermitian one-electron Hamiltonian
- Successfully completed objective
